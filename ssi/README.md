Current status:
- Stripped away additional packages and front end from Streetcred example [here](https://github.com/streetcred-id/iiw-demo). Will begin integrating with Front end later. 
- Dockerised, and added SSI component to the docker-compose start up scripts. 

To do: 
- Update the readme with instructions on how to get it up and running. 
- Get hot restarting of the javascript containers working
- Sort environment variables so they are all passed through the docker-compose.yml, and therefore all held in one place for ease of management.
